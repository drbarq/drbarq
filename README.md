# Hey, I'm Joe 👋

~~Vibe // Chaos~~

**Full-Stack Developer** | Building AI-powered tools | Teaching 2K+ developers about AI & development

I bridge the gap between complex technical solutions and real business value. I build scalable applications, create AI-powered products, and share what I learn with developers on TikTok.

## 🎥 Content & Community

I create educational content about AI tools, development workflows, and technical insights on TikTok. From explaining Claude Code to building MCP servers, I break down complex topics into digestible content.
